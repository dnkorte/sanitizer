Hand Sanitizer (or soap) dispenser uses peristaltic pump to dispense fluid when Adafruit VCNL Optical Proximity Sensor observes hand under dispensing tube.  Code runs on ItsyBitsy 32u4 5v version (which accepts 12v Vbat) and is coded in Arduino IDE.  This is all packaged in a 3d printed box, and uses a standard Jelly Jar to hold the fluid.
