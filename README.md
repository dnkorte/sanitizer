Hand Sanitizer (or soap) dispenser uses peristaltic pump to dispense fluid when Adafruit VCNL Optical Proximity Sensor observes hand under dispensing tube.  Code runs on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy 32u4 5v version (which may be powered by 12v Vbat) and is coded in Arduino IDE.  This is all packaged in a 3d printed container, and uses a standard Jelly Jar to hold the fluid.
